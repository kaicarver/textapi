This is how to deploy to Heroku:

  sudo git push heroku master

Regular commits just go to the GitHub repo without affecting the version currently deployed on Heroku.

Sometimes, you will have to authenticate to Heroku.

That's confusingly a different authentication from Github and from root, but don't panic, it's done pretty easily from the command line like so, which directs to a browser-based authentication on Heroku's site:

  sudo heroku login

To access the database:

  sudo heroku pg:psql -c "select created, message from note where created between '2020-07-03' and '2020-07-04';" --app "powerful-anchorage-09770"

See README.md for more database access commands.
